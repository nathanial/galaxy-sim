X Translate without re-paint

Incremental image scaling
    Correct bounds
    Increase DPI by chopping tile scale
        Compare tile pixels to window pixels
        As scale ratchets down, you want twice (X) as many tiles occupying the same space
            Tiles could subdivide/split into quadrants, each with as many pixels as the parent
            Remember the scale when the tile is created. Use that scale to size it properly in the viewport.
            Memoize individual tile creation, not "tiles". That way we can filter out the ones not in view, while still caching.
